# EDA_Animal_Shelter_Outcomes_v1
 
This project's goal is to perform an exploratory data analysis in order identify factors affecting the adoption rates of dogs and cats in animal shelters. The data used in this project was compiled by Jack Daoud from data from an animal shelter in Austin, Texas(https://www.austintexas.gov/austin-animal-center) and can be downloaded from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackdaoud/animal-shelter-analytics). The original data was provided by the [Austin City Council](https://data.austintexas.gov) and was collected from 2013 to 2021.
